== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to configure plugin to be compliant with Omnibus directive =

You don't have to do anything special, the default settings are compliant with Omnibus directive!

However, in case you misconfigured the plugin, here are steps to take to make it compliant again (please note similar suggestions hints you will see on Settings screen):

1. Go to `WooCommerce` > `Price History` screen
2. Set `Display on` to `Single product page`
3. Set `Display minimal price` to `Only when product is on sale`
4. Set `Count minimal price from` to `Day before product went on sale`
5. Set `Number of days to use when counting minimal price:` to `30 days`
6. For each product being on sale, go to its edit screen and set `Sale price dates from` to the date when the product went on sale.

= Is plugin working well with variable products? =

Yes, the plugin is compatible with product taxes and variable products (it tracks minimal price for each variation individually).

= Is there any shortcode I could use to display minimal price? =

If you want to display the lowest products price in other place than default, you can use shortcode `wc_price_history`. A few examples:

Display the lowest price on single product page (without passing product ID as argument), currency symbol attached:
```
This product low is [wc_price_history]
```

Display the lowest price of the other product, currency symbol attached:
```
The product with ID 3 had the lowest price [wc_price_history id=3]
```

Display without currency symbol:
```
The product with ID 3 had the lowest price [wc_price_history id=3 show_currency=0]
```

= For some products being on sale, plugin shows minimal price from current day, why? =

This is because you have not set `Sale price dates from` for these products. Go to the product edit screen and set `Sale price dates from` to the date when the product went on sale.

Tip: All the products which are On sale but does not have `Sale price dates from` set will be logged to WooCommerce logs. Go to `WooCommerce` > `Status` > `Logs` to see the list of products (in right top corner preselect log which name starts with wc-price-history).

= Can I adjust minimal price before being it displayed? =

Yes, you can use filter `wc_price_history_lowest_price_html_raw_value_taxed`:

```
add_filter( 'wc_price_history_lowest_price_html_raw_value_taxed', function( $price, $wc_product ) {
	// do something with $price
	return $price;
}, 10, 2 );
```
